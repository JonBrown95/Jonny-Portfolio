# Jonathan Brown's Portfolio

After finishing with Northcoders I took some time off coding as I went on holiday and then returned to work but I decided it was time to start creating my page that will showcase all of my hard work. I have done countless commits and often sit thinking of ways to improve it and there are always things to improve on but it was definitely created with love <3
